# Stable Voucher

> This allows **free** distibutions of cryptocurrencies to be [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) compliant ðŸ’¸

Stable voucher is a token wrapping system for stable coins. It allows administrators to give "Stable Vouchers" to refugees which are pegged to the United States Dollar. Refugees can spend their Stable Vouchers at approved vendors like grocery stores.

Grocery stores and other approved vendors are able to "cash out" these vouchers back to xDai whenever they need their funds liquid. This helps with KYC compliance by allowing distribution of vouchers **instead** of distributing crypto itself.
